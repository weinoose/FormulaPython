DIFFERENCES FROM REAL FORMULA ONE RACING
* We assume that refueling was banned and drivers started their races with a full tank during the era between 1998 and 2008, contrary to the truth.
* We assume that Bridgestone was the only tire manufacturer during the era between 1998 and 2008, contrary to the truth.
* We assume that there were no prohibitions on tire changes in 2005, contrary to the truth.
* We assume that the blown diffuser was never banned, contrary to the truth.
* We assume that every year of formula racing has the same post-race point distribution, contrary to the truth.
* We assume that every driver can finish a race without doing any pit stops to change their tires if it is possible during the race in dry or wet conditions, contrary to the truth.

CAR DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
* In terms of car development, there is no development limitation in each season or regulation period, and it is active for all regulation terms.
* In terms of durability updates, it is eligible within the +1 car traits equals -2 durability and -2 car traits equals +1 durability range.
* In terms of car weight updates, it is eligible within a +1 chassis trait equals +3 kilograms of weight and a -3 chassis trait equals -1 kilograms of weight range.
* In terms of engine performance development, it is eligible within a +1 upgrade -2 durability / -2 upgrade equals +1 durability range.
* FIA can give extra development allowance at the start of the season to particular teams if it seems fair.

CAR DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL REGULATIONS
* Chassis (3.500.000–5.000.000)
* Front Wing (5.000.000–7.000.000)
* Rear Wing (5.000.000–7.000.000)
* Base (5.000.000–7.000.000)
* Sidepod (2.500.000–4.000.000)
* Suspension (2.500.000-4.000.000)

CAR PRODUCTION FINANCIAL REGULATIONS
* The cost of producing a car ranges between 13 and 33 million dollars.

FINANCIAL REGULATIONS
* In terms of stopping the in-year development process and transferring future income for the next-year car available at any point, this yields an extra +0.5 million in each race.
* If the season is the last before a new regulation comes in, transferring the future income for the next year's car is only available for 3 races left until the season ends.

PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE HINT
* (car rating difference*0.112) equation equals the pace difference between manufacturers as a unit of seconds.
