# Formula Python
Welcome! Formula Python is an open-source simulation algorithm is maintaining by only myself which simulates a whole Formula 1 weekend with it's formal FIA regulations. I've started to develop this application at the begginning of the 2023 yet application has finally finished at 27/06/2023. It's open for everyone to try.

It has everything in it, yet I feel a bit lazy to demonstrate it. However, if you would dive inside, you'll find out how detailed it is. Probably the best in the bussiness.

Feel free to contact me about that: weinoose@gmail.com

Developer Log for the Development Process:
* 25/03/2023 — Project has started.
* 27/06/2023 — Project has finished.
* Current v1.0 — Developer working on first big update based on improved track positions for vehicles during the race.
