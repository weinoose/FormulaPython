# Formula Python
Welcome! Formula Python is an open-source simulation algorithm is maintaining by only myself which simulates a whole Formula 1 weekend with it's formal FIA regulations. The application has finally finished (21/05/2023) and open for everyone to try.

It has everything in it, yet I feel a bit lazy to demonstrate it. However, if you would dive inside, you'll find out how detailed it is. Probably the best in the bussiness.

Feel free to mail me about that: weinoose@gmail.com
