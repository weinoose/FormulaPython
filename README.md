# Formula Python
Welcome! Formula Python is an open-source simulation algorithm is maintaining by only myself which simulates a whole Formula 1 weekend with its formal FIA regulations. I started to develop this application at the beginning of 2023 yet the application has finally finished on 28/06/2023. It's open for everyone to try.

It has everything in it, yet I feel a bit lazy to demonstrate it. However, if you would dive inside, you'll find out how detailed it is. Probably the best in the business.

Feel free to contact me about that: weinoose@gmail.com
